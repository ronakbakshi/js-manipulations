    <ol>
        <li>Position the element <span class="code">#feedback</span> at the bottom right of the browser window, leaving
            a
            5 pixel gap on the right and bottom, keeping its original size. Make sure that any changes to the <span
                    class="code">.unknownCSS</span> selector won't affect your changes made to the <span class=code>#feedback
          element.
          </span>
        </li>

        <li>Using Javascript, loop through the object
            <pre>{q1:89, q2:75, q3:88}</pre>
            and show the key/entry pairs in a table like <span
                    class="code">#sampleTbl</span> (appended before the text "footer" inside the <span
                    class="code">&lt;I&gt;</span> tag at the bottom). <br>HINT: you can modify the content of the <span
                    class="code">&lt;I&gt;</span> element to help with this
        </li>

        <li>Using Javascript, add the following behavior to the <span class="code">#feedback</span> element: Toggle its
            color between the current color and yellow on each click
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Bonus:</b> Prevent the form <span class="code">form</span> from submitting when clicking
            <button
                    type="submit">submit
            </button>
            unless <input id="alphanumeric-input" name="name" type="text"
                          placeholder="[a-zA-Z0-9] only"> contains an alphanumeric string without spaces
